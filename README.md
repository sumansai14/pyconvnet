### How do we think about dimensionality

A Neural network library in python inspired from karapathys convnetjs

The project is structured as follows:

## Layers

## Optimizers

## Datasets

## Losses

## Estimators

## Regularizers ? (Perhaps later)

## TODO:

1. Fix the dataset - give credit ()
2. Fix the backward propagation in conv layers
3. More layers 
4. Implement regularizers
5. Batch Normalization
6. GPU Support, Vectorisation.
